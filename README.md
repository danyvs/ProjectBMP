# ProjectBMP
The following scenario scenario: 

	- Person A sends an encrypted image to person B. B can decrypt the image, getting the initial image. 
	- After that, he uses an algorithm to recognize the handwritten numbers using patterns, encrypts the image again and sends it to A. 
	- Person A decrypts this new image and visualizes the solution. 

Implement the encryption/ decryption algorithm and the pattern matching.
